Awarded Best Performer for two consecutive quarters (Q1 ’22 and Q2 ‘22) at Lowe’s India for my pivotal role in the successful conversion of legacy warehouses to LMS warehouses ahead of schedule. As a Product Owner and Business Analyst, I played a key role in managing stakeholder expectations and collaborating with a cross-functional team to ensure seamless execution. My efforts were instrumental in navigating the complexities of the project, leading to a 25% reduction in errors and meeting critical deadlines.
