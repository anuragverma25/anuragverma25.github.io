Independently managed the release of Encompix 10.3 at Aptean during the challenging period of COVID-19. Initially part of the team liaising with stakeholders and developers, I stepped up to take on dual roles as both a Business Analyst and Developer due to unforeseen resource shortages. My ability to switch between roles, manage development duties, and ensure smooth communication with stakeholders was crucial in delivering the project on time despite the constraints.
